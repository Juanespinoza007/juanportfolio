This website was created in a few weeks during the 2024 school semester.

# Creation
I utilized a lot of React.js and Tailwind CSS to create this page. I also deployed
the website on netlify and own the gabepalomino.com domain on GoDaddy!
For the 3D rendered objects I utilized SPLINE. It integrated well with React and I had a fun time creating my own 3D models.
I also utilized Email.js to create my contact-me form.

# Purpose
I wanted a more personalized page other than my github that displayed my projects while also
showcasing my skills in full-stack development. I also made sure the website works on all screen sizes
for anyone to access it through any medium. Nonetheless I utilized my favorite color 'Blue' for the pallete
of this site.
