This website was created in a few weeks right after 2025 Graduation.
Many assets were referenced from a template by [gabepalomin](https://github.com/gabepalomin) at
[gabepalomino.com](https://gabepalomino.com/#home)

# Creation
React.js and Tailwind CSS were used to create this page. I also deployed
the website on netlify and own the juanespin.com domain on Porkhub.
3D rendered objects were integrated using SPLINE.

# Purpose
I wanted to create a space to showcase all of my projects from both my undergrad in Aerospace and my Masters in Computer Engineering. The theme was chosen based off of my passion for space exploration.
